At 2 h after starting the programme, the GPU was consuming about 12 GB at the time.
Each chip had a length of 5.3 cm and the width was about 10 mm.
Over time, VRAM memory consumption rose beyond the 16 GB limit and the programme
crashed, though it ran really just short of 1024 MB. With better coding,
some GB might have been saved. It just took 120 sec to restart the programme.
