At 2 h after starting the programme, the GPU was consuming about 12.0 GB at the time. 
Each chip had a length of 5.3 cm and the width was about 1.0 cm. 
Over time, VRAM memory consumption rose beyond the 16.0 GB limit and the programme
crashed, though it ran really just short of 1.0 GB.  With better coding,
some GB might have been saved.  It just took 120 sec to restart the programme.
